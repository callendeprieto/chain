; NAME:
;       CURVEFIT
;
; PURPOSE:
;       Non-linear least squares fit to a function of an arbitrary 
;       number of parameters.  The function may be any non-linear 
;       function.  If available, partial derivatives can be calculated by 
;       the user function, else this routine will estimate partial derivatives
;       with a forward difference approximation.
;
; CATEGORY:
;       E2 - Curve and Surface Fitting.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       Result = CURVEFIT(X, Y, Weights, A, SIGMA, FUNCTION_NAME = name, $
;                         ITMAX=ITMAX, ITER=ITER, TOL=TOL, /NODERIVATIVE)
;
; INPUTS:
;       X:  A row vector of independent variables.  This routine does
;           not manipulate or use values in X, it simply passes X
;           to the user-written function.
;
;       Y:  A row vector containing the dependent variable.
;
;  Weights:  A row vector of weights, the same length as Y.
;            For no weighting,
;                 Weights(i) = 1.0.
;            For instrumental (Gaussian) weighting,
;                 Weights(i)=1.0/sigma(i)^2
;            For statistical (Poisson)  weighting,
;                 Weights(i) = 1.0/y(i), etc.
;
;       A:  A vector, with as many elements as the number of terms, that 
;           contains the initial estimate for each parameter.  IF A is double-
;           precision, calculations are performed in double precision, 
;           otherwise they are performed in single precision. Fitted parameters
;           are returned in A.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;       FUNCTION_NAME:  The name of the function (actually, a procedure) to 
;       fit.  IF omitted, "FUNCT" is used. The procedure must be written as
;       described under RESTRICTIONS, below.
;
;       ITMAX:  Maximum number of iterations. Default = 20.
;       ITER:   The actual number of iterations which were performed
;       TOL:    The convergence tolerance. The routine returns when the
;               relative decrease in chi-squared is less than TOL in an 
;               interation. Default = 1.e-3.
;       CHI2:   The value of chi-squared on exit (obselete)
;     
;       CHISQ:   The value of reduced chi-squared on exit
;       NODERIVATIVE:   IF this keyword is set THEN the user procedure will not
;               be requested to provide partial derivatives. The partial
;               derivatives will be estimated in CURVEFIT using forward
;               differences. IF analytical derivatives are available they
;               should always be used.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;       Returns a vector of calculated values.
;       A:  A vector of parameters containing fit.
;
; OPTIONAL OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
;       Sigma:  A vector of standard deviations for the parameters in A.
;
; COMMON BLOCKS:
;       NONE.
;
; SIDE EFFECTS:
;       None.
;
; RESTRICTIONS:
;       The function to be fit must be defined and called FUNCT,
;       unless the FUNCTION_NAME keyword is supplied.  This function,
;       (actually written as a procedure) must accept values of
;       X (the independent variable), and A (the fitted function's
;       parameter values), and return F (the function's value at
;       X), and PDER (a 2D array of partial derivatives).
;       For an example, see FUNCT in the IDL User's Libaray.
;       A call to FUNCT is entered as:
;       FUNCT, X, A, F, PDER
; where:
;       X = Variable passed into CURVEFIT.  It is the job of the user-written
;           function to interpret this variable.
;       A = Vector of NTERMS function parameters, input.
;       F = Vector of NPOINT values of function, y(i) = funct(x), output.
;       PDER = Array, (NPOINT, NTERMS), of partial derivatives of funct.
;               PDER(I,J) = DErivative of function at ith point with
;               respect to jth parameter.  Optional output parameter.
;               PDER should not be calculated IF the parameter is not
;               supplied in call. IF the /NODERIVATIVE keyword is set in the
;               call to CURVEFIT THEN the user routine will never need to
;               calculate PDER.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;       Copied from "CURFIT", least squares fit to a non-linear
;       function, pages 237-239, Bevington, Data Reduction and Error
;       Analysis for the Physical Sciences.  This is adapted from:
;       Marquardt, "An Algorithm for Least-Squares Estimation of Nonlinear
;       Parameters", J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math., Vol 11, no. 2, pp. 431-441,
;       June, 1963.
;
;       "This method is the Gradient-expansion algorithm which
;       combines the best features of the gradient search with
;       the method of linearizing the fitting function."
;
;       Iterations are performed until the chi square changes by
;       only TOL or until ITMAX iterations have been performed.
;
;       The initial guess of the parameter values should be
;       as close to the actual values as possible or the solution
;       may not converge.
;
; EXAMPLE:  Fit a function of the form f(x) = a * exp(b*x) + c to
;           sample pairs contained in x and y.
;           In this example, a=a(0), b=a(1) and c=a(2).
;           The partials are easily computed symbolicaly:
;           df/da = exp(b*x), df/db = a * x * exp(b*x), and df/dc = 1.0
;
;           Here is the user-written procedure to return F(x) and
;           the partials, given x:
;
;       pro gfunct, x, a, f, pder      ; Function + partials
;         bx = exp(a(1) * x)
;         f= a(0) * bx + a(2)         ;Evaluate the function
;         IF N_PARAMS() ge 4 THEN $   ;Return partials?
;         pder= [[bx], [a(0) * x * bx], [replicate(1.0, N_ELEMENTS(f))]]
;       end
;
;         x=findgen(10)                  ;Define indep & dep variables.
;         y=[12.0, 11.0,10.2,9.4,8.7,8.1,7.5,6.9,6.5,6.1]
;         Weights=1.0/y            ;Weights
;         a=[10.0,-0.1,2.0]        ;Initial guess
;         yfit=curvefit(x,y,Weights,a,sigma,function_name='gfunct')
;         print, 'Function parameters: ', a
;         print, yfit
;       end
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;       Written, DMS, RSI, September, 1982.
;       Does not iterate IF the first guess is good.  DMS, Oct, 1990.
;       Added CALL_PROCEDURE to make the function's name a parameter.
;              (Nov 1990)
;       12/14/92 - modified to reflect the changes in the 1991
;            edition of Bevington (eq. II-27) (jiy-suggested by CreaSo)
;       Mark Rivers, U of Chicago, Feb. 12, 1995
;           - Added following keywords: ITMAX, ITER, TOL, CHI2, NODERIVATIVE
;             These make the routine much more generally useful.
;           - Removed Oct. 1990 modification so the routine does one iteration
;             even IF first guess is good. Required to get meaningful output
;             for errors. 
;           - Added forward difference derivative calculations required for 
;             NODERIVATIVE keyword.
;           - Fixed a bug: PDER was passed to user's procedure on first call, 
;             but was not defined. Thus, user's procedure might not calculate
;             it, but the result was THEN used.
;
;      Steve Penton, RSI, June 1996.
;            - Changed SIGMAA to SIGMA to be consistant with other fitting 
;              routines.
;            - Changed CHI2 to CHISQ to be consistant with other fitting 
;              routines.
;            - Changed W to Weights to be consistant with other fitting 
;              routines.
;            _ Updated docs regarding weighing.
;           
;	Carlos, July 2002, returns a(*)=-1000 and sigma=a when 
;	fails to converge or there is not enough input data for the desired
;	degrees of freedom.
